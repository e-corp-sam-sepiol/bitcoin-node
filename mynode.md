### [https://www.mynodebtc.com/](https://www.mynodebtc.com/ "https://www.mynodebtc.com/")

myNode aims to be the easiest way to run a dedicated, easy to use, Bitcoin Node and Lightning Wallet. By combining the best open source software with a user friendly UI, management, and monitoring software, you can easily, safely, and securely use Bitcoin and Lightning.

myNode is a dedicated device that provides access to the Bitcoin and Lightning networks along with a number of other features! By using a dedicated device, like myNode, you get uptime, reliability, and ease-of-use that other software-only solutions cannot provide.

By running a Bitcoin and Lightning on your myNode device, you maintain all the security and advantages originally intended in the Bitcoin protocol. Information about your Bitcoin addresses and spending is verified by your local node and removes the need to trust online 3rd parties for getting information about your funds.

## ðŸ“Œ Why Operate Your Own Lightning Network Node?
There are many reasons why you might want to set up your own Lightning node. They include:

- To be a full, active participant in the Lightning Network, not just an end-user.
- To run an e-commerce store or receive income via Lightning payments.
- To earn income from Lightning routing fees or by renting channel liquidity.
- To develop new services, applications, or plugins for the Lightning Network.
- To increase your financial privacy while using Lightning.
- To use some apps built on top of Lightning, like Lightning-powered Instant Messaging apps.
- For financial freedom, independence, and sovereignty.

There are costs associated with running a Lightning Network node. You need a computer, a permanent Internet connection, lots of disk space, and lots of time!

Operational costs will include electricity expenses.
